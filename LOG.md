# Plans
* For the UI, http://Shrew.app style Python in browser, allowing user to see progressive improvements to output as s/he provides more examples.
* Enabling reason-less transformations, where those can be done with confidence, by leveraging PbE techniques of Rishabh Singh and Sumit Gulwani 

# Considering
* Utilizing Armando Solar-Lezama's Sketch as an Exemplar backend, to help Exemplar fill in more difficult code unknowns ("holes").
