# Plans
* For the UI, http://Shrew.app -style Python in-browser, allowing user to see progressive improvements to output as s/he provides more examples.
* Enabling reason-less transformations, where those can be done with confidence, by leveraging PbE techniques of Rishabh Singh and Sumit Gulwani 

# Considering
* Utilizing Armando Solar-Lezama's Sketch as an Exemplar backend, to help Exemplar fill in more difficult code unknowns ("holes").

# Log of work
* 2019-01-10 TG got Skulpt working. I studied QuickFoil, Brachylog, Eurisko, and mini-cp while thinking about how to make Exemplar (E) less niche and more tolerant of incomplete examples. Answer is nonobvious, so I'll instead concentrate on extending E in more or less its current form until it is useful to me. If successful, adaptions can then be made for friendliness. E.g., a user won't need to decide if 'reason's are needed for a particular program synthesis before investing time in E vs another PbE system if E includes the typical ability to work without them. 3h
* 2019-01-09 Installed pycallgraph and created prime_number_call_graph.png. 2h
* 2019-01-08 Got student TG started figuring out Skulpt (in-browser Python), 12:30 - 13:30. (TG is reminded of another UI to Python: Jupyter notebooks. Taking a look now, I wonder if instead of entering Python code and getting plots out, user could enter unit tests etc in the cells and get Python functions out. Such that an "Exemplar notebook" == program.) 1h
* 2019-01-07 Explained Exemplar to advanced computer science student TG, 10am - 11am. 1h
