Exemplar is passing all 7 tests of TestExemplar.py, which include Fizz Buzz, a leap year predicate, and a prime number 
predicate.  You can see these inputs as fizz_buzz.exem, leap_year.exem, etc.  
But 
* that success is partly by overfitting to the problems.  
* there is no recovery from an incorrect guess of what an assertion represents.  
* the assertion specifications are too demanding.

So demotion of the assertions to hints and other improvements are planned.
